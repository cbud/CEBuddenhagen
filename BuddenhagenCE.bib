  abstract = {Eradication programmes were initiated against infestations of the introduced blackberry species R. adenotrichos and R. megaloccocus on Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos, Ecuador, in 1999 and 2000 respectively. The species were judged to be likely invaders even though neither produced viable seeds in Galapagos. Prior to eradication in 2003 these infestations occupied an area of less than a quarter hectare. I estimate the time and dollar cost of eradication of R. adenotrichos and R. megaloccocus to be US\$11 ,322 US dollars/1 738 hours. More than half of these costs were sustained in extensive systematic searches of 330 ha surrounding known infestations. Herbicide accounted for less than 1\% of total costs. Control was undertaken using the herbicides glyphosate, and a combination of metsulfuron methyl and picloram. I recommend using teams of workers dedicated to eradicating known or potentially invasive species early in the invasion process or prior to establishment in Galapagos.}

Seventeen species previously known to occur only in cultivation in Galapagos are now considered escaped. A number of species known to be naturalized in the humid highlands of Santa Cruz do not appear to be able to reproduce in Puerto Ayora's drier climate. To determine which introduced species should be a priority for control or eradication, the potential invasiveness of each species was assessed based on their distribution and behaviour in Galapagos and elsewhere. At least 13 species were considered potentially serious invaders that could be feasible to eradicate.}

  abstract = {Plant invasions are causing habitat degradation in Galapagos. Problems are concentrated on the four inhabited islands. Plants introduced to rural areas in the humid highlands and urban areas on the arid coast act as foci for invasion of the surrounding Galapagos National Park. Here we present results of the most comprehensive inventory to date of alien vascular plants in the inhabited areas of Galapagos. The survey was conducted between 2002 and 2007, in 6031 properties (97\% of the total) on Floreana, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz Islands. In total 754 alien vascular plant taxa were recorded, representing 468 genera in 123 families. Dicotyledons represented 554 taxa, monocotyledons 183, there were 7 gymnosperms and 10 pteridophytes. Almost half (363) of the taxa were herbaceous. The most represented families were Fabaceae (sensu lato), Asteraceae and Poaceae. The three most recorded species in the humid rural areas were Psidium guajava, Passiflora edulis and Bryophyllum pinnatum, and in the dry urban areas, Aloe vera, Portulaca oleracea and Carica papaya. In total, 264 (35\%) taxa were recorded as naturalized. The most common use for taxa was ornamental (52\%). This extensive survey has increased the known alien vascular flora of Galapagos by 257 species, giving a ratio of alien to native taxa of 1.57{$:$}1. It provides a crucial baseline for plant invasion management in the archipelago and contributes data for meta analyses of invasion processes worldwide. A repeat of the survey in the future would act as an effective early detection tool to help avoid further invasion of the Galapagos National Park.}

Among the risks associated with their cultivation is the potential to exacerbate the invasive species problem. Evidence is growing that many proposed biofuel crops are ideally suited to become successful invaders. We compared actual and candidate terrestrial biofuel crops suitable for temperate and tropical climates with introduced, nonbiofuel species, and demonstrated that biofuel species are almost three-times more likely to naturalize and over twice as likely to be invasive as nonbiofuel crops in both climatic conditions. Similar potential may exist for algae biofuels. The risks could be mitigated, and unintended environmental costs avoided, by implementing precautions including assessing and removing the worst invaders from consideration, selecting lower risk species for widespread cultivation, and actively controlling the spread of crops from cultivated areas. {\copyright} 2010 Future Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Application of herbicides inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) has been one of the main strategies for selectively controlling grass weed species such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in wheat and barley crops in New Zealand. In this study, we have confirmed and characterized resistance to pinoxaden, an ACCaseinhibiting herbicide, in a population of L. perenne. Dose-response experiments were conducted to assess the level of pinoxaden resistance, and based on the LD50 values, the studied population was 41.4-times more resistant to pinoxaden than a susceptible population. Application of malathion, an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450s, preceding pinoxaden treatment reduced the level of resistance to 9.7-fold. However, pre-treatment with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibitor 4-chloro7- nitrobenzoxadiazole prior to pinoxaden treatment did not affect pinoxaden resistance. Partial sequencing of the ACCase gene revealed that the resistant population had an isoleucine to valine replacement at position 2041. These results suggest that both cytochrome P450-based and target-site mechanisms are jointly associated with this instance of pinoxaden resistance in L. perenne. The pinoxaden-resistant L. perenne individuals were also resistant to quizalofop-p-ethyl (108.6-fold), but they were susceptible to clethodim, which can, therefore, be used to manage this pinoxaden-resistant L. perenne. This is the first report of a L. perenne population in which a rare target-site mutation works in concert with enhanced cy\- tochrome P-450 activity to confer pinoxaden resistance. Evolution of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in this L. perenne population indicates that integrated weed management practices are required to prevent widespread resistance developing in New Zealand cereal crop systems.},

Higher quality information may help to target the high-benefit locations, but often actions are needed with limited information. The value of information (VOI) in this context is formalized by evaluating the results of decision making guided by a set of specific information compared to the results of acting without considering that information. We present a framework for management performance mapping that includes evaluating the VOI for decision making about geographic priorities in regional intervention strategies, in case studies of Andean and Kenyan potato seed systems. We illustrate use of recursive partitioning, XGBoost, and Bayesian network models to characterize the relationships among seed health and yield responses and environmental and management predictors used in studies of seed degeneration. These analyses address the expected performance of an intervention based on geographic predictor variables. In the Andean example, positive selection of seed from asymptomatic plants was more effective at high altitudes in Ecuador. In the Kenyan example, there was the potential to target locations with higher technology adoption rates and with higher potato cropland connectivity, i.e., a likely more important role in regional epidemics. Targeting training to high management performance areas would often provide more benefits than would random selection of target areas. We illustrate how assessing the VOI can contribute to targeted development programs and support a culture of continuous improvement for interventions.},

It is, therefore, crucial to have a rapid, reliable and cost-effective technique to assess samples for herbicide resistance. We designed and evaluated three derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) markers for detecting glyphosate resistance in               Lolium perenne               . conferred by non-synonymous mutations at codon-106 in the               enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase               (               EPSPS               ) gene.

The results showed that all three dCAPS markers could successfully detect mutations at codon-106 in the target enzyme. The dCAPS markers can also inform us of the zygosity state of the resistance allele and was confirmed by sequencing the target region of the               EPSPS               gene.

As the off-target reads from such sequencing are expected to be similar to genome skimming (GS), we assessed the quality of repeat characterization in plant genomes using this data.Repeat composition obtained from TCS datasets of five Rhynchospora (Cyperaceae) species were compared with GS data from the same taxa. In addition, a FISH probe was designed based on the most abundant satellite found in the TCS dataset of Rhynchospora cephalotes. Finally, repeat-based phylogenies of the five Rhynchospora species were constructed based on the GS and TCS dataset and the topologies were compared with a gene-alignment based phylogenetic tree.All the major repetitive DNA families were identified in TCS, including repeats that showed abundances as low as 0.01 \% in the GS data. Rank correlation between GS and TCS repeat abundances were moderately high (r = 0.58-0.85), increasing after filtering out the targeted loci from the raw TCS reads (r = 0.66-0.92). Repeat data obtained by TCS was also reliable to develop a cytogenetic probe of a new variant of the holocentromeric satellite Tyba. Repeat-based phylogenies from TCS data were congruent with those obtained from GS data and the gene-alignment tree.Our results show that off-target TCS reads can be recycled to identify repeats for cyto- and phylogenomic investigations. Given the growing availability of TCS reads, driven by global phylogenomic projects, our strategy represents a way to recycle genomic data and contribute to a better characterization of plant biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The genomic revolution offers renewed hope of resolving rapid radiations in the Tree of Life. The development of the multispecies coalescent model and improved gene tree estimation methods can better accommodate gene tree heterogeneity caused by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and gene tree estimation error stemming from the short internal branches. However, the relative influence of these factors in species tree inference is not well understood. Using anchored hybrid enrichment, we generated a data set including 423 single-copy loci from 64 taxa representing 39 families to infer the species tree of the flowering plant order Malpighiales. This order includes 9 of the top 10 most unstable nodes in angiosperms, which have been hypothesized to arise from the rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Here, we show that coalescent-based methods do not resolve the backbone of Malpighiales and concatenation methods yield inconsistent estimations, providing evidence that gene tree heterogeneity is high in this clade. Despite high levels of ILS and gene tree estimation error, our simulations demonstrate that these two factors alone are insufficient to explain the lack of resolution in this order. To explore this further, we examined triplet frequencies among empirical gene trees and discovered some of them deviated significantly from those attributed to ILS and estimation error, suggesting gene flow as an additional and previously unappreciated phenomenon promoting gene tree variation in Malpighiales. Finally, we applied a novel method to quantify the relative contribution of these three primary sources of gene tree heterogeneity and demonstrated that ILS, gene tree estimation error, and gene flow contributed to 10.0\${\textbackslash}\%\$, 34.8\${\textbackslash}\%\$, and 21.4\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the variation, respectively. Together, our results suggest that a perfect storm of factors likely influence this lack of resolution, and further indicate that recalcitrant phylogenetic relationships like the backbone of Malpighiales may be better represented as phylogenetic networks. Thus, reducing such groups solely to existing models that adhere strictly to bifurcating trees greatly oversimplifies reality, and obscures our ability to more clearly discern the process of evolution.

  abstract = {To estimate the prevalence of herbicide-resistant weeds, 87 wheat and barley farms were randomly surveyed in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Over 600 weed seed samples from up to 10 mother plants per taxon depending on abundance, were collected immediately prior to harvest (two fields per farm). Some samples provided by agronomists were tested on an ad-hoc basis. Over 40,000 seedlings were grown to the 2--4 leaf stage in glasshouse conditions and sprayed with high priority herbicides for grasses from the three modes-of-action acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibitors haloxyfop, fenoxaprop, clodinafop, pinoxaden, clethodim, acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibitors iodosulfuron, pyroxsulam, nicosulfuron, and the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS)-inhibitor glyphosate. The highest manufacturer recommended label rates were applied for the products registered for use in New Zealand, often higher than the discriminatory rates used in studies elsewhere. Published studies of resistance were rare in New Zealand but we found weeds survived herbicide applications on 42 of the 87 (48\%) randomly surveyed farms, while susceptible reference populations died. Resistance was found for ALS-inhibitors on 35 farms (40\%) and to ACCase-inhibitors on 20 (23\%) farms. The number of farms with resistant weeds (denominator is 87 farms) are reported for ACCase-inhibitors, ALS-inhibitors, and glyphosate respectively as:               Avena fatua               (9\%, 1\%, 0\% of farms),               Bromus catharticus               (0\%, 2\%, 0\%),               Lolium               spp. (17\%, 28\%, 0\%),               Phalaris minor               (1\%, 6\%, 0\%), and               Vulpia bromoides               (0\%, not tested, 0\%).

  abstract = {Despite an extensive history of research into herbicide resistance in New Zealand maize, some aspects remain understudied. Herbicide resistance was first detected in New Zealand in the 1980s in maize crops, with atrazine resistance in Chenopodium album L. and Persicaria maculosa Gray. Since then, Chenopodium album has also developed resistance to dicamba, and in the last five years Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. populations have been reported to be resistant to nicosulfuron. Here we estimate the risk of herbicide resistance arising in 39 common maize weeds. A list of weeds associated with maize was generated, omitting uncommon weeds and those that grow outside of the maize growing season. Weeds were ranked for their risk of evolving herbicide resistance with a scoring protocol that accounts for the specific herbicides used in New Zealand maize. Seven weed species were classified as having a high risk of developing herbicide resistance: Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.Beauv., Chenopodium album, Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn., Xanthium strumarium L., Amaranthus powellii S.Watson, Solanum nigrum L. and Digitaria sanguinalis. Seventeen species were classed as moderate risk, and 15 were low risk. Herbicide classes associated with more resistant species were classed as high risk,these included acetohydroxy acid synthase inhibitors and photosystem-II inhibitors. Synthetic auxins had a ~moderate risk but only two herbicides in this class (dicamba and clopyralid) are registered for maize in New Zealand. Other herbicide mode-of-action groups used in maize were low risk. We recommend outreach ~to farmers regarding weed-control strategies that prevent high-risk species from developing resistance. High-risk herbicide groups should be monitored for losses of efficacy. Resistance surveys should focus on these species and herbicides.},

  abstract = {When successful, the operation of local and international networks of crop seed distribution or ``seed systems'' ensures farmer access to seed and impacts rural livelihoods and food security. Farmers are both consumers and producers in seed systems and benefit from access to global markets. However, phytosanitary measures and seed purity tests are also needed to maintain seed quality and prevent the spread of costly weeds, pests and diseases, in some countries regulatory controls have been in place since the 1800s. Nevertheless, seed contaminants are internationally implicated in between 7\% and 37\% of the invasive plant species and many of the agricultural pests and diseases. We assess biosecurity risk across international seed trade networks of forage crops using models of contaminant spread that integrate network connectivity and trade volume. To stochastically model hypothetical contaminants through global seed trade networks, realistic dispersal probabilities were estimated from quarantine weed seed detections and incursions from border security interception data in New Zealand. For our test case we use contaminants linked to the global trade of ryegrass and clover seed. Between 2014 and 2018 only four quarantine weed species (222 species and several genera are on the quarantine schedule) warranting risk mitigation were detected at the border. Quarantine weeds were rare considering that average import volumes were over 190 tonnes for ryegrass and clover, but 105 unregulated contaminant species were allowed in. Ryegrass and clover seed imports each led to one post-border weed incursion response over 20 years. Trade reports revealed complex global seed trade networks spanning {$>$}134 (ryegrass) and {$>$}110 (clover) countries. Simulations showed contaminants could disperse to as many as 50 (clover) or 80 (ryegrass) countries within 10 time-steps. Risk assessed via network models differed 18\% (ryegrass) or 48\% (clover) of the time compared to risk assessed on trade volumes. We conclude that biosecurity risk is driven by network position, the number of trading connections and trade volume. Risk mitigation measures could involve the use of more comprehensive lists of regulated species, comprehensive inspection protocols, or the addition of field surveillance at farms where seed is planted.},

  abstract = {Imports of seeds for sowing are a major pathway for the introduction of contaminant seeds, and many agricultural weeds globally naturalised originally have entered through this pathway. Effective management of this pathway is a significant means of reducing future plant introductions and helps minimise agricultural losses. Using a national border inspection database, we examined the frequency, origin and identity of contaminant seeds within seed for sowing shipments entering New Zealand between 2014--2018. Our analysis looked at 41,610 seed lots across 1,420 crop seed species from over 90 countries. Overall, contamination was rare, occurring in 1.9\% of all seed lots. Among the different crop types, the arable category had the lowest percentage of seed lots contaminated (0.5\%) and the forage category had the highest (12.6\%). Crop seeds Capsicum, Phaseolus and Solanum had the lowest contamination rates (0.0\%). Forage crops Medicago (27.3\%) and Trifolium (19.8\%) had the highest contamination rates. Out of 191 genera recorded as contaminants, Chenopodium was the most common. Regulated quarantine weeds were the rarest contaminant type, only occurring in 0.06\% of seed lots. Sorghum halepense was the most common quarantine species and was only found in vegetable seed lots. Vegetable crop seed lots accounted for approximately half of all quarantine species detections, Raphanus sativus being the most contaminated vegetable crop. Larger seed lots were significantly more contaminated and more likely to contain a quarantine species than smaller seed lots. These findings support International Seed Testing Association rules on maximum seed lot weights. Low contamination rates suggest industry practices are effective in minimising contaminant seeds. Considering New Zealand inspects every imported seed lot, utilises a working sample size 5 times larger than International Seed Testing Association rules require, trades crop seed with approximately half of the world's countries and imports thousands of crop seed species, our study provides a unique overview of contaminant seeds that move throughout the seed for sowing system.}

Within this family the genus Rhynchospora has recently become the focus of several studies that characterize the organization of the holocentric karyotype and genome structures. To broaden our understanding of genome evolution in this genus, representatives of Rhynchospora were studied to contrast chromosome features, C-CMA/DAPI band distribution and genome sizes. Here, we carried out a comparative analysis for 35 taxa of Rhynchospora, and generated new genome size estimates for 20 taxa. The DNA 2C-values varied up to 22-fold, from 2C = 0.51 pg to 11.32 pg, and chromosome numbers ranged from 2n = 4 to 61. At least 37\% of our sampling exhibited 2n different from the basic number x = 5, and chromosome rearrangements were also observed. A large variation in C-CMA/DAPI band accumulation and distribution was observed as well. We show that genome variation in Rhynchospora is much larger than previously reported. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most taxa were grouped in clades corresponding to previously described taxonomic sections. Basic chromosome numbers are the same within every section, however, changes appeared in all the clades. Ancestral chromosome number reconstruction revealed n = 5 as the most likely ancestral complements, but n = 10 appears as a new possibility. Chromosome evolution models point to polyploidy as the major driver of chromosome evolution in Rhynchospora, followed by dysploidy. A negative correlation between chromosome size and diploid number open the discussion for holokinetic drive-based genome evolution. This study explores relationships between karyotype differentiation and genome size variation in Rhynchospora, and contrasts it against the phylogeny of this holocentric group.},

The structure of seed networks also helps to determine the epidemiological risk for seedborne disease. We present a new approach for evaluating the epidemiological role of nodes in seed networks, and apply it to a regional potato farmer consortium (Consorcio de Productores de Papa [CONPAPA]) in Ecuador. We surveyed farmers to estimate the structure of networks of farmer seed tuber and ware potato transactions, and farmer information sources about pest and disease management. Then, we simulated pathogen spread through seed transaction networks to identify priority nodes for disease detection. The likelihood of pathogen establishment was weighted based on the quality or quantity of information sources about disease management. CONPAPA staff and facilities, a market, and certain farms are priorities for disease management interventions such as training, monitoring, and variety dissemination. Advice from agrochemical store staff was common but assessed as significantly less reliable. Farmer access to information (reported number and quality of sources) was similar for both genders. However, women had a smaller amount of the market share for seed tubers and ware potato. Understanding seed system networks provides input for scenario analyses to evaluate potential system improvements. Copyright {\copyright} 2017 The Author(s).

  abstract = {The number of herbicide-resistant weeds is increasing globally. A successful management practice requires an understanding of how resistance traits are inherited. Weed scientists worldwide have investigated the mode of inheritance for herbicide resistance in weeds. Depending on the resistance gene/mechanism, varied patterns of inheritance have been documented in weed species. In most of the target-enzyme mechanism cases, the mode of inheritance involves a single nuclear gene. However, maternal (cytoplasmic) inheritance has also been documented for triazine-resistant weeds with the target-enzyme mutation mechanism of resistance. Resistance from target-enzyme overexpression is not always associated with the single-gene model of inheritance. Depending on the type of resistance, allelic dominance varies between complete dominance, semi-dominance and recessive for both target-enzyme mutation and target-enzyme overexpression mechanisms. The nontarget site mechanism of resistance is however, more complex. The pattern of inheritance in weeds with nontarget site resistance is quite variable and should be investigated case by case. The pattern of inheritance has a crucial role in the dynamics of herbicide-resistance within a weed population, and knowledge about the inheritance of herbicide resistance traits could help develop predictive models and novel strategies to prevent the spread of resistance allele(s).},

  abstract = {Seed systems are critical for deployment of improved varieties but also can serve as major conduits for the spread of seedborne pathogens. As in many other epidemic systems, epidemic risk in seed systems often depends on the structure of networks of trade, social interactions, and landscape connectivity. In a case study, we evaluated the structure of an informal sweet potato seed system in the Gulu region of northern Uganda for its vulnerability to the spread of emerging epidemics and its utility for disseminating improved varieties. Seed transaction data were collected by surveying vine sellers weekly during the 2014 growing season. We combined data from these observed seed transactions with estimated dispersal risk based on village-to-village proximity to create a multilayer network or ``supranetwork.'' Both the inverse power law function and negative exponential function, common models for dispersal kernels, were evaluated in a sensitivity analysis/ uncertainty quantification across a range of parameters chosen to represent spread based on proximity in the landscape. In a set of simulation experiments, we modeled the introduction of a novel pathogen and evaluated the influence of spread parameters on the selection of villages for surveillance and management. We found that the starting position in the network was critical for epidemic progress and final epidemic outcomes, largely driven by node out-degree. The efficacy of node centrality measures was evaluated for utility in identifying villages in the network to manage and limit disease spread. Node degree often performed as well as other, more complicated centrality measures for the networks where village-to-village spread was modeled by the inverse power law, whereas betweenness centrality was often more effective for negative exponential dispersal. This analysis framework can be applied to provide recommendations for a wide variety of seed systems.},

This contrasts with the analysis of the same programme by Gardener et al. (Restor Ecol 18:20-29, 2010), which concluded that 87 \% of projects failed. The difference arises because Gardener et al. (2010) wrongly included 15 plant populations which either had not been completely evaluated, or had been evaluated as potential eradication targets but excluded as not feasible with available resources (i.e. they were not eradication projects), while they omitted six further projects, of which two had already achieved eradication. Of the projects which they labelled as "failed", two have also since achieved eradication, while five others are still in progress with eradication as their stated objective. They also abandoned six high-feasibility projects that were showing promising results. They placed the programme in the context of the "novel ecosystem" paradigm, which views much ecosystem restoration as futile, especially invasive species management. However, the Galapagos programme was designed to address small populations of incipient invasives, where eradication is more a tool to prevent the future impacts of new invaders than a tool for restoration. We show that eradication of plants in this context is achievable when a simple prior feasibility assessment is made.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents an overview of the process undertaken to understand alien plant invasions and work towards their effective management in the Galapagos Islands. Galapagos is a unique case study for the management of alien plants in protected areas because much the archipelago has few alien plants and the original ecosystems are relatively intact. We discuss a pragmatic approach developed over 15 years to help prioritise management of 871 plant species introduced to the islands. This approach includes understanding invasion pathways; identifying which species are present and their distribution; determining invasive species impact on biodiversity, ecosystem function and mutualisms; prioritising management using weed risk assessment; guidelines to prevent further introduction through quarantine and early intervention; and developing methods to control or eradicate priority species. Principal barriers to application of the approach are limited capacity and coordination among managers and inherent difficulties arising from invasive species traits such as seed banks and dispersal and their interactions with ecosystems. We also discuss the approach of managing invasive species individually and suggest it may be more appropriate, when feasible, for the relatively intact uninhabited islands and dry regions of Galapagos. The more degraded highlands of the inhabited islands need a more complex approach that balances costs with prioritised outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem functionality.},

  abstract = {Vulpia bromoides (L.) Gray (hair grass) is a serious grass weed of New Zealand cereal crops, contaminating seed and reducing yield. Optimal management of this weed may be achieved when the environmental factors that affect its emergence are well understood. Emergence may then be predicted and manipulated through land management techniques, e.g. through the promotion of germination (irrigation) or the prevention of it (soil inversion), thus enabling optimisation of weed control. The hydrothermal time for germination of V. bromoides was determined in order to better understand when germination and emergence occurs and how environmental conditions including soil temperature (T) and water potential ({$\Psi$}) may influence this. The germination profile of V. bromoides was determined on a thermogradient table. Seeds were also incubated under constant factorial combinations of temperature and water potential in order to better understand the water potential required for the germination of this species. The rate of germination of V. bromoides was slowest from 5 to 7{$^\circ$}C and most rapid from 13 to 32{$^\circ$}C. At temperatures of 5 to 15{$^\circ$}C V. bromoides experienced reduced germination rates at water potentials between --0.75 to --1.00 MPa. At temperatures of 20 and 25{$^\circ$}C V. bromoides germinated rapidly across all of the water potentials assessed. These results will inform the development of optimised weed management on farm.},

Cases included weeds in turf, pastures, orchards, vineyards, forage and arable crops. Surprisingly little is known about the spatial extent or frequency of this problem in New Zealand. We estimate that 14,000 farms have land-use histories like those favouring herbicide resistance historically. Sampling simulations of {$\geq$}10\% farms provided good estimates of resistance prevalence for most regions and crop types. Acceptable sampling rates varied with target population size, actual resistance prevalence, and detection certainty. Our simulations provide a sobering caution regarding our ability to delimit the problem cheaply or accurately. Detection rates lower than 75\% always give imprecise prevalence estimates. Sampling and screening involved 7.4 h labour and 27 km of travel costing \$759 NZD per farm.

A protocol was used that accounts for both the risk that different herbicides will select for resistance and each weed's propensity to develop herbicide resistance based on the number of cases worldwide. To provide context we documented current herbicide use patterns. Most weeds (55) were low-risk, 30 were medium-risk and 16 high-risk. The top ten scored weeds were Echinochloa crus-galli, Poa annua, Lolium multiflorum, Erigeron sumatrensis, Raphanus raphanistrum, Lolium perenne, Erigeron bonariensis, Avena fatua, Avena sterilis and Digitaria sanguinalis. Seven out of ten high-risk weeds were grasses. The most used herbicides were synthetic auxins, an enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase inhibitor, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors, and long-chain fatty acid inhibitors. ALS-inhibitors were assessed as posing the greatest risk for more species than other modes-of-action. Despite pre-emergence herbicides being known to delay resistance, New Zealand farmers only applied flufenacet and terbuthlazine with high frequency. Based on our analysis, surveys for herbicideresistant species should focus on the high-risk species we identified. Farmer extension efforts in New Zealand should address resistance evolution in cropping weeds.},

The complex interactions between them and other pasture plants, livestock and the environment imply a need for innovative research that transforms pasture management. To this end, a horizon scan was conducted to identify relevant issues, questions, opportunities, and drivers. The drivers were ranked using three criteria: (1) is this a horizon (is the driver likely to become important in 10--20 years?); (2) will the research require stretchy science (is it currently not well addressed by the science community?); (3) is the research transformative (will successful scientific research in this area lead to significant changes to weed management in pastures?). We identified 11 major issues and 46 subordinate ones. The three highest ranked major issues were: (1) anticipated reductions in access to herbicides; (2) rethinking weed management under an ecosystem services paradigm; (3) responding to shifts in best practice and the regulations that are altering farm system planning to reduce farming's environmental impacts. We conclude that fundamental interdisciplinary research is needed that addresses biosecurity and weed management issues, while reducing the environmental footprint of farming and maintaining productivity.}

Cases of glyphosate, glufosinate and amitrole-resistant ryegrass were documented in a few vineyards in New Zealand in 2013, but there have been no regional surveys for resistance. To address this knowledge gap, 106 vineyards were visited across the important New Zealand wine-growing regions of Marlborough and Waipara in late February 2021, and Hawke's Bay and Gisborne in late February 2022, and seed samples from individual plants at each site surviving weed-control measures were collected. Ryegrass was found in more South Island (68\%) than North Island (20\%) vineyards. These seeds, and those from a susceptible ryegrass population were sown in marked rows into trays (10-20 seeds per herbicide) and grown in a glasshouse. When seedlings reached the 3-4 leaf stage, trays were sprayed at the highest recommended label rate of glyphosate. Samples with enough seed were also screened against additional herbicides, amitrole, glufosinate or clethodim. The results indicated 39\% of the surveyed vineyards contained glyphosate-resistant ryegrass, with cases detected across all regions, including 58\% of vineyards in Marlborough. Eleven of the 27 Marlborough vineyards screened contained amitrole-resistant ryegrass; six samples were also resistant to glyphosate. However, glufosinate and clethodim were still effective against ryegrass at the sites tested. Considering the levels of herbicide resistance to ryegrass observed in this study, growers should explore alternative weed-suppression measures, including tilling, cover-crops, grazing, mowing and the use of herbicides with different modes of action.},

The resistant population was 264 times more resistant to iodosulfuron than a susceptible population, based on a ratio of the rate corresponding to a 50\% reduction in resistant and susceptible plant survival (R/S LD50). The resistant population was also 14times more resistant to nicosulfuron, another ALS-inhibitor of the same class. However, no resistance to imazapyr, an ALS-inhibitor from a different chemical class, was detected in the resistant population. Pre-treatment with an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 reduced the level of iodosulfuron resistance to 46-fold in the resistant population, suggesting enhanced herbicide metabolism, a non-target site mechanism, contributed to resistance of this herbicide. In addition, a proline to leucine substitution at codon 197 was detected, suggesting a target-site-based mechanism was also associated with resistance to iodosulfuron. This is the first report on the resistance mechanisms to ALS-inhibiting herbicides identified in Lolium perenne in New Zealand and highlights the importance of integrated weed management approaches to reduce the likelihood of ALS-inhibitor herbicide resistance becoming more widespread.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The setting and following of phytosanitary standards for weed seeds can lessen the impacts of weed on agriculture. Standards adopted by seed companies, laboratories and regulators ensure the contamination rates do not exceed some thresholds. Globally sample size standards are set based on the amount needed to obtain a contaminant in a random sample of the seed lot, not detectability. New Zealand requires a 95\% confidence that the maximum pest limit of 0.01\% of quarantine weed seed contamination is not exceeded in an imported seed lot. We examined 24 samples each containing approximately 150,000 seeds of either perennial ryegrass (12 samples) or white clover seeds (12 samples) that were then spiked with seeds (contaminants) from twelve non-crop species (3-8 seeds of each). We considered factors that may impact detection rates: shape, colour, size, and texture relative to the crop, and technician (including a commercial seed laboratory). RESULTS A linear mixed model fitted to the data indicated significant observer, crop, and seed colour, shape, and size effects on detection. Compared to the crop larger weed seeds were 23\% {\textpm} 8.7 ({\textpm} standard error) more likely to be detected than smaller seeds, and those with a distinct shape (20\% {\textpm} 7.7) or colour (28\% {\textpm} 8.1). Commercial laboratory identifications were usually correct at the level of genus, and species for common weeds, but some misidentifications occurred. CONCLUSION Sample sizes for border inspections should be based on detectability of regulated weed seeds in the crop in combination with weed risk for the crop and location.},

Although satDNAs are usually fast evolving, some satDNA families may be conserved across species separated by several millions of years, probably because of their functional roles in the genomes. Tyba was the first centromere-specific satDNA described for a holocentric organism, until now being characterized for only eight species of the genus Rhynchospora Vahl. (Cyperaceae). Here, we characterized Tyba across a broad sampling of the genus, analysing and comparing its evolutionary patterns with other satDNAs.                                         Methods               We characterized structure and sequence evolution of satDNAs across a robust hyb-seq-based dated phylogeny of 70 species. We mined the repetitive fraction for Tyba-like satellites to compare its features to other satDNAs and to construct a Tyba-based phylogeny for the genus.                                         Key Results               Our results show that Tyba is present in the majority of examined species of the genus, spanning four out of five major clades and maintaining intrafamily pairwise identity of 70.9\% over 31 My. In comparison, other satellite families presented higher intrafamily pairwise identity, but are phylogenetically restricted. Furthermore, Tyba sequences could be divided in 12 variants grouped into three different clade-specific subfamilies, showing evidence of traditional models of satDNA evolution, such as concerted evolution and library hypothesis. Besides, a Tyba-based phylogeny showed high congruence with the hyb-seq topology. Our results show structural indications of a possible relationship of Tyba with nucleosomes, given its high curvature peaks over conserved regions and overall high bendability values compared to other non-centromeric satellites.                                         Conclusions               Overall, Tyba shows a remarkable sequence conservation and phylogenetic significance across the genus Rhynchospora, which suggests that functional roles may lead to long-time stability and conservation for satDNAs in the genome.},

It impacts the productivity, market value and welfare of livestock through its sharp penetrating that cause blindness and the downgrading of wool, hides, and carcasses. In this study we estimate the benefit of preventing its spread as the present value (PV) of local (regional) and national productivity losses that would accrue over 200 years under a `do nothing' spread scenario. Using a 3\% discount rate and two assumed spread rates, 201 and 100 years to 90\% occupation of its potential range, we calculate national PV losses of NZ\$ 192 million and NZ\$ 1,160 million respectively. In a breakeven analysis, these losses, which equate to the national benefits of preventing the spread, justify annual expenditures of NZ\$ 5.3 million and NZ\$ 34 million respectively. Restricting the analyses to the regions with known infestations (Hawke's Bay, Marlborough, Canterbury) provided much lower estimates of the benefits (ranging from NZ\$ 16.8 million to NZ\$ 158 million) because spillover benefits from preventing spread to the other susceptible regions are not accounted for. These analyses support a nationally coordinated approach to managing N. neesiana in New Zealand involving surveillance and control measures respectively in the susceptible and infested regions.},

We present a spatiotemporal description of nitrate use efficiency in terms of metabolic responses and  carbohydrate remobilization, together with components of cytokinin signal transduction following nitrate addition to N-impoverished plants. Perennial ryegrass (               L. perenne               cv. Grasslands Nui) plants were grown for 10\,weeks in unfertilized soil and then treated with nitrate (5\,                                m                 M                              ) hydroponically. Metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed a dynamic interaction between N and carbon metabolism over a week-long time course represented by the relative abundance of amino acids, tricarboxylic acid intermediates and stored water-soluble carbohydrates (               WSCs               ). The initial response to N addition was characterized by a rapid remobilization of carbon stores from the low-molecular weight               WSC               , along with an increase in N content and assimilation into free amino acids. Subsequently, the shoot became the main source of carbon through remobilization of a large pool of high-molecular weight               WSC               . Associated quantification of cytokinin levels and expression profiling of putative cytokinin response regulator genes by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction support a role for cytokinin in the mediation of the response to N addition in perennial ryegrass. The presence of high levels of               cis               -zeatin-type cytokinins is discussed in the context of hormonal homeostasis under the stress of steady-state N deficiency.},

  abstract = {New Zealand lacks appropriate response frameworks for recent invasions where eradication is no longer considered feasible. There are {$>$}50,000 exotic species naturalised in New Zealand. Most are not currently invasive, but predicting which will become invasive, and when, is challenging. We require new tools for rapid development of management responses to these ``sleeper pests'' when they emerge as invasive threats.    Social resistance limits the success of invasive species management responses. Existing invasive species response simulation frameworks do not consider the impact of social factors on management success. Conversely, simulation approaches incorporating social factors do not include changes in habitat suitability (e.g. through climate change). We present new simulation methods capable of integrating both change in the biophysical context (e.g. climate and land use) and in the social context (e.g. public willingness to manage sleeper pests).   Two simulation functions -- INApest() and INApestMeta() - were developed to simulate pest spread and management under changing climates and in response to social interventions. The difference between them is that INApestMeta() incorporates local population dynamics in simulating pest spread and response to management. Both functions are implemented within spread models for case-study species. INApest() was implemented for Chilean needle grass (a pasture weed), while INApestMeta() was implemented for the tomato red spider mite (a horticultural pest) and for Argentine ants (a residential and horticultural pest). Selected simulation experiments are presented illustrating the ability of INApest() and INApestMeta() to compare a wide range of management and public engagement scenarios under changing climates.}

  abstract = {Imported seed lots provide a major pathway for weed seed contaminants, and many of the weeds that are naturalised globally originated as contaminants in seed lots. Management of these trade pathways helps minimise agricultural loss and is a significant means of preventing future biological invasions. This study obtained MPI data on plant contaminants found within imported seed lots entering New Zealand from 2014--2018. In total, we examined records for 41,610 seed lots across 1,420 crop seed species. Since little is known about which variables are most associated with contaminants in seed lots entering New Zealand, examination of interception data is useful in assisting MPI with their targeted biosecurity efforts. Analysis of interception data can also be used by foreign inspection agencies to help identify levels of risk across the industry. Given that all seed lots entering New Zealand are inspected at a higher rate when compared with other foreign inspection agencies, MPI data provide a particularly complete view of the contaminants that move throughout the system. This study aims to help inform MPI and New Zealand's trading partners by determining: 1) the most commonly contaminated crop seeds and crop types entering New Zealand, including corresponding contamination rates; 2a) the most common contaminants; 2b) the most common category of contaminant; 2c) which crop types and exporting country are most commonly associated with a quarantine weed; and 3) whether size of a seed lot is linked to contamination.}

  abstract = {Herbicide-resistant weeds were first detected in New Zealand in 1979. Since then, reporting has been ad hoc, relying on growers and rural professionals to recognise cases and then for researchers to have the resources to carry out experiments that confirm resistance. The commencement of an MBIE-funded programme `Managing Herbicide Resistance' in 2018 allowed the first systematic approach to survey for herbicide-resistant weeds in arable crops. The first survey in 2018/19 involved collecting seeds from weeds present in arable crops on 48 randomly selected farms, representing 20\% of arable farms in central Canterbury. These seeds were sown in pots and the seedlings were sprayed, when they had 2--4 leaves, at label rates using a range of herbicides commonly used to control that species. In 2019, 12 out of the 48 farms had weeds resistant to Group A and B herbicides. Species included ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and wild oats (Avena fatua) growing as weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and clover (Trifolium spp.) fields. A further 28 farms in south Canterbury surveyed in 2020 are expected to show similar levels of resistance. The funding has also provided resources for industry representatives and growers to send material suspected of resistance to researchers for investigation. Via word-of-mouth advertising, we received 16 self-reported samples of suspected resistant weeds (wild oats, ryegrass and chickweed (Stellaria media)) from agronomists and herbicide representatives. Ongoing research includes comprehensive dose-response experiments, heritability and the determination of the mechanisms involved i.e. target-site or nontarget-site of resistance. The work is promising to: bring the herbicide-resistance conversation into the mainstream; show the geographic extent of the problem; and reinforce the need to implement best practices that slow its development. Future surveys will capture information about resistance cases in maize farms, a crop historically known to produce cases of resistance in New Zealand.},

Standards adopted by seed companies, laboratories and regulators focus on ensuring the contamination rates are not higher than some threshold level. Recommended sample rates focus on the sample size needed to obtain a contaminant in a random sample of the seed lot, not detectability. To examine detectability, we had technicians examine spiked 12 samples of ca. 150,000 ryegrass and clover crop seeds with seeds from twelve non-crop species (3-8 seeds of each) and consider shapes, relative colour, relative size, texture and technician (including a commercial seed lab). Commercial lab identifications were usually correct at the level of genus, and species for common weeds, but identification errors were common. A linear model fit to the data indicated there were significant technician, crop, colour, shape and size effects on detection e.g., larger seeds were 23\% more likely to be found than smaller seeds, seeds distinctly different in colour (20\%) and distinctly different in shape 27\% were more likely to found. There was no difference between crops for seed lab detection rates, but the other technicians detected fewer seeds in ryegrass. For the regulated species Alopecurus myosuroides detection rates ranged from 7\% to 61\%. New Zealand requires a 95\% confidence that the maximum pest limit of 0.01\% of quarantine weed seed contamination is not exceeded an imported seed lot. We discuss whether this is achieved under current inspection standards.}

R2M also includes geographic risk analysis such as cropland connectivity analysis, and management scenario analysis such as impact network analysis. We provide examples of R2M applications in several countries and introduce the latest R2M options available for new applications. It is hoped that the R2M framework will provide the basis for a global community of practice trying to solve similar problems. We discuss examples involving the following: (1) Expert elicitation.

  abstract = {Research on maize weeds in New Zealand is extensive, but few systematic efforts were made to determine their prevalence and abundance. The most recent `weeds survey' in maize is two decades old. Weeds most problematic are those difficult to control with herbicides. The first cases of resistance were in the 1980s, Chenopodium album L. and Persicaria maculosa Gray, which both evolved resistance to atrazine. Atrazine-resistant C. album then evolved additional resistance to dicamba in the eastern Waikato in the 2000s. Recently, Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. evolved resistance to nicosulfuron in Bay of Plenty and Waikato maize farms. Apart from C. album - presumed widespread - the prevalence of resistant weeds was unknown in maize. Fifty-two maize fields in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato were sampled in late January-early February 2021 for weeds. Weed percentage cover was assessed, weed seed was collected and soil samples were taken. Weeds emerged from soil samples were identified and enumerated. One-hundred and thirty-four plant species were observed. Digitaria sanguinalis, C. album and Persicaria spp. were the most widespread weeds, observed in 98\%, 85\% and 71\% of farms, respectively. Widespread weeds abundant in fields ({$\geq$}1\% cover) were D. sanguinalis, C. album, Persicaria spp., Cyperus rotundus L. and Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv. In seedbanks, C. album, D. sanguinalis and Persicaria spp. were common, as well as winter/spring weeds Juncus bufonius L., Poa annua L. and Stellaria media (L.) Vill. Post-emergent herbicides were applied to C. album, D. sanguinalis and Persicaria spp. seedlings. No resistance was detected for Persicaria spp. to any herbicide, nor for Chenopodium album to dicamba, nicosulfuron and mesotrione, but 22 farms (42\%) had atrazine resistant C. album. Seven farms (13\%) had nicosulfuron resistant D. sanguinalis. Resistant D. sanguinalis survived from 60 g.ai.ha-1, twice the rate susceptible plants survived, but two populations survived 240 g.ai.ha-1. Five farms had both nicosulfuron-resistant D. sanguinalis and atrazine resistant C. album, and a total 24 farms (46\%) had a resistant weed.}

  abstract = {Invasive species incursion responses are a complex interplay of ecological processes (establishment, growth, natural and human-aided dispersal), management actions (surveillance, local eradication and spread reduction) and multiple actors (central and local government, industry bodies and private citizens). Network-based simulation is increasingly used to integrate these social and ecological processes. We present an example which builds on recent advances (specifically, the impact network analysis, INA, framework) and provides unprecedented flexibility in modelling the co-evolution of invasive species incursions and management responses. The functionality we added to INA permits inclusion of habitat (e.g., climate and land use) impacts on establishment, with potential to incorporate temporal variation in habitat suitability. There is explicit provision for separate natural and human-aided dispersal processes and temporal variation in invasion threat from external sources (e.g., national, or regional border incursions). The system separates the management response into detection, local eradication, spread reduction (e.g., restricted movement of plant material and livestock, cleaning machinery and other equipment) and management adoption components. Various incursion response strategies can be explored including sentinel sites (selecting locations of higher detection probability), preventative management in locations threatened by newly discovered incursions, enforcement of hygiene or movement-restriction measures and awareness raising in target population (e.g., farmers, seed companies, garden centres). The system retains the key functionality of INA, particularly inclusion of socioeconomic network structure in modelling information sharing (about the presence of the pest and management practices). To illustrate the potential of this approach we examine the spread of a regionally restricted harmful weed, {$<$}em{$>$}Nassella neesiana {$<$}/em{$>$}(Chilean needle grass, CNG). During seeding in late summer for three months of the year, the sharp seeds can penetrate animal hides and can be spread by livestock or contaminated equipment, so farmers typically do not graze these paddocks. CNG is regulated by three different regional authorities in New Zealand because of the risk to the sheep and beef sector. With CNG established in Hawkes Bay Region, we examine the biosecurity risk posed to the currently uninvaded adjacent region of Manawatu-Wanganui under current and future climate, and with and without management of the current infestations in Hawkes Bay. Climate change increases the area potentially impacted in Manawatu-Wanganui. With the zero-management scenario in Hawkes Bay the annual incursion rate on farms in Manawatu-Wanganui eventually exceeds 12 incursions per year, while under realistic management settings in Hawkes Bay incursions decline to 0.4 events per year.},

Herbicides are one means for mitigating weed impact, however herbicide resistance is a growing issue. Timely confirmation of resistance is required for initiating management plans and preventing its spread.  We have established a high-throughput multi-amplicon-sequencing and analysis pipeline for rapid identification of target-site resistance mutations in the ACCase, ALS and EPSPS genes targeted by Groups 1, 2 and 9 (glyphosate) herbicide modes-of-action, respectively. This `Quick' test amplifies discrete regions of these three genes in a single reaction which are then sequenced, enabling identification of variants known to confer resistance to these herbicides, and their zygosity. This method facilitates rapid screening of a range of ryegrass species including Lolium perenne, L. multiflorum, and L. hybridum and has identified resistance in ryegrass species sampled from different land-based systems. From a sample of 80 farm-derived resistant plants, we confirmed that approximately 38 had herbicide resistance-conferring mutations in the ACCase and ALS genes, and of these, 10 plants harboured resistance alleles in both genes. The method is being assessed with other weed species such as L. rigidum, Avena fatua, Phalaris spp., Poa spp., and Alopecurus myosuroides. This platform greatly simplifies testing for these common types of herbicide resistance and can be used to inform the management response. Furthermore, this technology could be used to identify and remove resistance alleles from Lolium breeding material when developing ryegrass cultivars as a way to minimise unintended spread of herbicide resistance.}

We planted out seed from 56 distinct lots (28 per year) from 52 varieties, into 1.5 by 5 meter plots over two years, with four replicates per seed-lot and herbicide (336 randomized plots per year). Plots were treated with haloxyfop (Group 1), iodosulfuron (Group 2) and glyphosate at the highest recommended rate. Each herbicide was applied to approximately 30 to 80 thousand seedlings at the three-leaf stage, estimated survival rates were less than 2\%. Eight weeks after treatment, up to 20 survivors were collected per variety and herbicide, grown in the glasshouse and tillered for respraying to confirm resistance to the herbicide treatments -- because some plants could have been late germinators or somehow escaped exposure. Out of the 56 seed-lots (11 were from NZ, 45 were imported), resistance was confirmed for 44 lots, including some breeder's lines. All NZ seed lots had resistant plants. Estimated resistance rates were between 1:20 and 1:70000, with seed lots classed as resistant to either haloxyfop (9 lots), iodsulfuron (10 lots) or both (25 lots), but none survived glyphosate. Some lines contained Poa annua that survived iodosulfuron as well. We speculate that resistance-conferring variants may occur normally in ryegrass at rates of 1:7000 or rarer, but 29 seed lots had higher rates.}

Herbicides are one means for managing weed incursions, however herbicide resistance in target plants is a growing issue. Rapid confirmation of incidences of resistance is required for initiating management plans and preventing its spread. Currently, herbicide resistance is confirmed by collecting, growing, then testing suspected plant material with doses of that herbicide -- approximately a two-month process. As part of an AgResearch-led MBIE programme (Managing Herbicide Resistance), we developed genetic tests targeting known changes in plant DNA that underpin herbicide resistance. These `Quick' tests allow us to confirm some forms of herbicide resistance a day after extracting DNA from candidate plants. Our initial focus was glyphosate resistance in perennial ryegrass -- a growing problem in vineyards and arable systems. We developed a method that identifies DNA changes linked to glyphosate resistance and susceptibility in perennial ryegrass and have confirmed glyphosate resistance across a range of populations. We have also established another method (GT-seq) that scans DNA for changes in genes that give rise to resistance to glyphosate, Group A, and Group B herbicides in annual, perennial and hybrid ryegrass. This technology allows a rapid survey of up to 6000 samples per analysis. Using this method, a recent survey of Canterbury farms with suspected herbicide resistance in perennial ryegrass showed that several of plants carried resistance to both Group A and Group B herbicides. This method is being expanded to include wild oats, black grass and Lolium rigidum, a significant weed in Australia. By developing and implementing these `Quick' tests in other important weed species, we will be providing additional tools in the toolbox to manage herbicide resistance.}

Ryegrass and clover seed is sold to local and international markets, contributing ca. \$125 million in sales. To control biosecurity risks, imported seed is inspected using the International Seed Testing Association Rules to determine physical purity and contamination by weed seeds. Enforcement measures against seed consignments based on the weed contaminants are rare. A quarantine list identifies ca. 1170 species of concern. We examined seed contaminants from inspections carried out by the Ministry for Primary Industries over five years (2014--2018). Eight seed companies contributed to most of the importations. Seed lots were sourced from 17 (ryegrass) and 19 (clover) countries. Of the 560 ryegrass consignments, 16\% had weed contaminants and 0.5\% contained the quarantine species Alopecurus myosuroides and Arctium minus. Of 381 clover consignments, 19\% were contaminated but no quarantine weed seeds were detected. A total of 65 and 62 contaminating weed species were detected in ryegrass and clover respectively. The most common were Polygonum aviculare and Poa annua in ryegrass, and Lolium spp. and Chenopodium album in clover. Most weed seed detections do not cause a shipment to be re-dressed or destroyed. The frequency with which weed seed contaminants are missed during inspection is not known and there is concern that some seeds could be from herbicide-resistant genotypes. The New Zealand arable industry participates in an international seed network that supports arable and pasture farming worldwide, but this has important biosecurity risks.}

We gained insights into contextually unique cases of resistance previously undescribed in the literature in New Zealand, including ryegrass resistance to glyphosate in a barley crop, Poa annua resistance to iodosulfuron in wheat, and Phalaris minor resistance to iodosulfuron in wheat. Resistance was typically confirmed 6--8 weeks after planting seed samples, though for species with seed after-ripening requirements to ensure consistent germination, results took as long as 6 months. The results facilitated conversations about long-term resistance avoidance strategies. Future costs of an independent resistance testing service would ideally be shared by the stakeholders benefitting from the crop protection product value chain, from herbicide producers to land managers.},

Dicamba-resistant               C               .               album               were not detected, nor were atrazine-resistant               P               .               maculosa               . Nicosulfuron resistant               D               .               sanguinalis               was recorded in 19\% of Waikato farms, 6\% of Bay of Plenty farms and 9\% of Hawkes Bay farms (no Wellington farms).               Amaranthus               spp.,               Fallopia convolvulus               ,               Persicaria               spp.,               Solanum               spp.,               Echinochloa crus-galli               ,               Panicum               spp. and               Setaria               spp. were not resistant to any of the herbicides tested. Twenty-nine to 52\% of maize farms in the North Island are estimated to have herbicide resistant weeds. Resistance is common in maize farms in Waikato and western Bay of Plenty. Resistance is rare in southern regions, with only one instance of nicosulfuron-resistant               D               .               sanguinalis               and no resistant               C               .               album               . Most annual weeds in maize are not resistant to herbicides; although atrazine resistant               C               .               album               is widespread, it is currently controlled with alternative herbicides. Resistant               D               .               sanguinalis               appears to be an emerging problem.},
