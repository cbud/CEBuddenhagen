    "text": "I first learned about a Sankey graph from Tufte’s data visualization book (Tufte 1983). It is a heartbreaking image of Napoleon’s army’s attempt to invade Moscow, but instead of victory, thousands died through a mix of war and unhygienic and freezing weather as the marched to Moscow and back to France. My purposes for this post are much more mundane, quite unimportant relatively - to look at weightings of a project with criteria.\nHow can data be used to generate a Sankey graph? You need project and criteria node names arranged in terms of weights and the target and sources for links Table 2. This way nodes and links are sized according the assigned weights Figure 1 - an example of its application is in my other post for our weed horizon scan.\nThe package is a network package networkD3Allaire et al. (2017).\nThe data can be read in from an external file, you need the nodes to be listed and numbered from 0 and on up to the number of nodes in one file, the names should match the criteria and project titles Table 1.\nGenerate some random weights for this exercise, I am using 3 criteria, for the 5 projects so I need 15 weights.\nThen generate the table with project names and weights. The link colors are determined by the names on the nodes and it can have problems recognizing names as unique if the first word is the same and there are spaces. I used Project 1, Project 2, etc and it didn’t recognize the nodes as distinct until I named them 1 Project, 2 Project, etc.\nThen generate the Figure 1. Just note it is outputting and html widget, looks a lot better on a desktop screen."

A major goal of my work has been to inform and influence management and policy with respect to biosecurity, biodiversity (including systematics and evolution), and natural resources. Apart from recent work on herbicide resistance and seed biosecurity my research has focused on invasive plants, animal impacts, plant epidemiology, plant phylogenomics and systematics. Prior to completing my doctorate, I worked in non-academic roles that focused on biosecurity issues related to invasive plant and animal policy and management in New Zealand, Galapagos and Hawaii.\nA post-doc in Dr. Garrett’s lab provided a stimulating work environment. We were looking at plant epidemiology, disease incidence, and food security within a project about roots, tubers and bananas. Collaborators work in Asia, Africa and South America in the CGIAR research consortium. These crops are all subject to “seed degeneration” whereby yields are reduced by the accumulation of pathogens (often these are viruses) over successive plantings of vegetative planting material (and farmer to farmer spread through “seed systems”). I completed my PhD with Austin Mast at Florida State University in 2016. I also spent a few years working as a curator in the herbarium at FSU. My post-doc was in Professor Karen Garrett’s lab.\n\n\nContact\nYou can write me at on gmail @ cbuddenhagen.
