  abstract = {With the advance of high-throughput sequencing (HTS), reduced-representation methods such as target capture sequencing (TCS) emerged as cost-efficient ways of gathering genomic information, particularly from coding regions. As the off-target reads from such sequencing are expected to be similar to genome skimming (GS), we assessed the quality of repeat characterization in plant genomes using this data.Repeat composition obtained from TCS datasets of five Rhynchospora (Cyperaceae) species were compared with GS data from the same taxa. In addition, a FISH probe was designed based on the most abundant satellite found in the TCS dataset of Rhynchospora cephalotes. Finally, repeat-based phylogenies of the five Rhynchospora species were constructed based on the GS and TCS dataset and the topologies were compared with a gene-alignment based phylogenetic tree.All the major repetitive DNA families were identified in TCS, including repeats that showed abundances as low as 0.01 \% in the GS data. Rank correlation between GS and TCS repeat abundances were moderately high (r = 0.58-0.85), increasing after filtering out the targeted loci from the raw TCS reads (r = 0.66-0.92). Repeat data obtained by TCS was also reliable to develop a cytogenetic probe of a new variant of the holocentromeric satellite Tyba. Repeat-based phylogenies from TCS data were congruent with those obtained from GS data and the gene-alignment tree.Our results show that off-target TCS reads can be recycled to identify repeats for cyto- and phylogenomic investigations. Given the growing availability of TCS reads, driven by global phylogenomic projects, our strategy represents a way to recycle genomic data and contribute to a better characterization of plant biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Imports of seeds for sowing are a major pathway for the introduction of contaminant seeds, and many agricultural weeds globally naturalised originally have entered through this pathway. Effective management of this pathway is a significant means of reducing future plant introductions and helps minimise agricultural losses. Using a national border inspection database, we examined the frequency, origin and identity of contaminant seeds within seed for sowing shipments entering New Zealand between 2014–2018. Our analysis looked at 41,610 seed lots across 1,420 crop seed species from over 90 countries. Overall, contamination was rare, occurring in 1.9\% of all seed lots. Among the different crop types, the arable category had the lowest percentage of seed lots contaminated (0.5\%) and the forage category had the highest (12.6\%). Crop seeds Capsicum, Phaseolus and Solanum had the lowest contamination rates (0.0\%). Forage crops Medicago (27.3\%) and Trifolium (19.8\%) had the highest contamination rates. Out of 191 genera recorded as contaminants, Chenopodium was the most common. Regulated quarantine weeds were the rarest contaminant type, only occurring in 0.06\% of seed lots. Sorghum halepense was the most common quarantine species and was only found in vegetable seed lots. Vegetable crop seed lots accounted for approximately half of all quarantine species detections, Raphanus sativus being the most contaminated vegetable crop. Larger seed lots were significantly more contaminated and more likely to contain a quarantine species than smaller seed lots. These findings support International Seed Testing Association rules on maximum seed lot weights. Low contamination rates suggest industry practices are effective in minimising contaminant seeds. Considering New Zealand inspects every imported seed lot, utilises a working sample size 5 times larger than International Seed Testing Association rules require, trades crop seed with approximately half of the world’s countries and imports thousands of crop seed species, our study provides a unique overview of contaminant seeds that move throughout the seed for sowing system.}

  abstract = {Seed systems are critical for deployment of improved varieties but also can serve as major conduits for the spread of seedborne pathogens. As in many other epidemic systems, epidemic risk in seed systems often depends on the structure of networks of trade, social interactions, and landscape connectivity. In a case study, we evaluated the structure of an informal sweet potato seed system in the Gulu region of northern Uganda for its vulnerability to the spread of emerging epidemics and its utility for disseminating improved varieties. Seed transaction data were collected by surveying vine sellers weekly during the 2014 growing season. We combined data from these observed seed transactions with estimated dispersal risk based on village-to-village proximity to create a multilayer network or “supranetwork.” Both the inverse power law function and negative exponential function, common models for dispersal kernels, were evaluated in a sensitivity analysis/ uncertainty quantification across a range of parameters chosen to represent spread based on proximity in the landscape. In a set of simulation experiments, we modeled the introduction of a novel pathogen and evaluated the influence of spread parameters on the selection of villages for surveillance and management. We found that the starting position in the network was critical for epidemic progress and final epidemic outcomes, largely driven by node out-degree. The efficacy of node centrality measures was evaluated for utility in identifying villages in the network to manage and limit disease spread. Node degree often performed as well as other, more complicated centrality measures for the networks where village-to-village spread was modeled by the inverse power law, whereas betweenness centrality was often more effective for negative exponential dispersal. This analysis framework can be applied to provide recommendations for a wide variety of seed systems.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of herbicide resistance in ryegrass (Lolium spp.) in the wine-growing regions in New Zealand is poorly understood. Cases of glyphosate, glufosinate and amitrole-resistant ryegrass were documented in a few vineyards in New Zealand in 2013, but there have been no regional surveys for resistance. To address this knowledge gap, 106 vineyards were visited across the important New Zealand wine-growing regions of Marlborough and Waipara in late February 2021, and Hawke’s Bay and Gisborne in late February 2022, and seed samples from individual plants at each site surviving weed-control measures were collected. Ryegrass was found in more South Island (68\%) than North Island (20\%) vineyards. These seeds, and those from a susceptible ryegrass population were sown in marked rows into trays (10-20 seeds per herbicide) and grown in a glasshouse. When seedlings reached the 3-4 leaf stage, trays were sprayed at the highest recommended label rate of glyphosate. Samples with enough seed were also screened against additional herbicides, amitrole, glufosinate or clethodim. The results indicated 39\% of the surveyed vineyards contained glyphosate-resistant ryegrass, with cases detected across all regions, including 58\% of vineyards in Marlborough. Eleven of the 27 Marlborough vineyards screened contained amitrole-resistant ryegrass; six samples were also resistant to glyphosate. However, glufosinate and clethodim were still effective against ryegrass at the sites tested. Considering the levels of herbicide resistance to ryegrass observed in this study, growers should explore alternative weed-suppression measures, including tilling, cover-crops, grazing, mowing and the use of herbicides with different modes of action.},

  abstract = {There is widespread interest in biofuel crops as a solution to the world's energy needs, particularly in light of concerns over greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite reservations about their adverse environmental impacts, no attempt has been made to quantify actual, relative or potential invasiveness of terrestrial biofuel crops at an appropriate regional or international scale, and their planting continues to be largely unregulated. Using a widely accepted weed risk assessment system, we analyzed a comprehensive list of regionally suitable biofuel crops to show that seventy percent have a high risk of becoming invasive versus one-quarter of non-biofuel plant species and are two to four times more likely to establish wild populations locally or be invasive in Hawaii or in other locations with a similar climate. Because of climatic and ecological similarities, predictions of biofuel crop invasiveness in Hawaii are applicable to other vulnerable island and subtropical ecosystems worldwide. We demonstrate the utility of an accessible and scientifically proven risk assessment protocol that allows users to predict if introduced species will become invasive in their region of interest. Other evidence supports the contention that propagule pressure created by extensive plantings will exacerbate invasions, a scenario expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation. Proactive measures, such as risk assessments, should be employed to predict invasion risks, which could then be mitigated via implementation of appropriate planting policies and adoption of the "polluter-pays" principle.}

Cases included weeds in turf, pastures, orchards, vineyards, forage and arable crops. Surprisingly little is known about the spatial extent or frequency of this problem in New Zealand. We estimate that 14,000 farms have land-use histories like those favouring herbicide resistance historically. Sampling simulations of ≥10\% farms provided good estimates of resistance prevalence for most regions and crop types. Acceptable sampling rates varied with target population size, actual resistance prevalence, and detection certainty. Our simulations provide a sobering caution regarding our ability to delimit the problem cheaply or accurately. Detection rates lower than 75\% always give imprecise prevalence estimates. Sampling and screening involved 7.4 h labour and 27 km of travel costing \$759 NZD per farm.

The structure of seed networks also helps to determine the epidemiological risk for seedborne disease. We present a new approach for evaluating the epidemiological role of nodes in seed networks, and apply it to a regional potato farmer consortium (Consorcio de Productores de Papa [CONPAPA]) in Ecuador. We surveyed farmers to estimate the structure of networks of farmer seed tuber and ware potato transactions, and farmer information sources about pest and disease management. Then, we simulated pathogen spread through seed transaction networks to identify priority nodes for disease detection. The likelihood of pathogen establishment was weighted based on the quality or quantity of information sources about disease management. CONPAPA staff and facilities, a market, and certain farms are priorities for disease management interventions such as training, monitoring, and variety dissemination. Advice from agrochemical store staff was common but assessed as significantly less reliable. Farmer access to information (reported number and quality of sources) was similar for both genders. However, women had a smaller amount of the market share for seed tubers and ware potato. Understanding seed system networks provides input for scenario analyses to evaluate potential system improvements. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Evaluation of project progress, feasibility and costs suggests that for {$<$} US\$100,000 (2015 prices) another 12 projects could achieve eradication within 5 years. This contrasts with the analysis of the same programme by Gardener et al. (Restor Ecol 18:20-29, 2010), which concluded that 87 \% of projects failed. The difference arises because Gardener et al. (2010) wrongly included 15 plant populations which either had not been completely evaluated, or had been evaluated as potential eradication targets but excluded as not feasible with available resources (i.e. they were not eradication projects), while they omitted six further projects, of which two had already achieved eradication. Of the projects which they labelled as "failed", two have also since achieved eradication, while five others are still in progress with eradication as their stated objective. They also abandoned six high-feasibility projects that were showing promising results. They placed the programme in the context of the "novel ecosystem" paradigm, which views much ecosystem restoration as futile, especially invasive species management. However, the Galapagos programme was designed to address small populations of incipient invasives, where eradication is more a tool to prevent the future impacts of new invaders than a tool for restoration. We show that eradication of plants in this context is achievable when a simple prior feasibility assessment is made.},

  abstract = {When successful, the operation of local and international networks of crop seed distribution or “seed systems” ensures farmer access to seed and impacts rural livelihoods and food security. Farmers are both consumers and producers in seed systems and benefit from access to global markets. However, phytosanitary measures and seed purity tests are also needed to maintain seed quality and prevent the spread of costly weeds, pests and diseases, in some countries regulatory controls have been in place since the 1800s. Nevertheless, seed contaminants are internationally implicated in between 7\% and 37\% of the invasive plant species and many of the agricultural pests and diseases. We assess biosecurity risk across international seed trade networks of forage crops using models of contaminant spread that integrate network connectivity and trade volume. To stochastically model hypothetical contaminants through global seed trade networks, realistic dispersal probabilities were estimated from quarantine weed seed detections and incursions from border security interception data in New Zealand. For our test case we use contaminants linked to the global trade of ryegrass and clover seed. Between 2014 and 2018 only four quarantine weed species (222 species and several genera are on the quarantine schedule) warranting risk mitigation were detected at the border. Quarantine weeds were rare considering that average import volumes were over 190 tonnes for ryegrass and clover, but 105 unregulated contaminant species were allowed in. Ryegrass and clover seed imports each led to one post-border weed incursion response over 20 years. Trade reports revealed complex global seed trade networks spanning {$>$}134 (ryegrass) and {$>$}110 (clover) countries. Simulations showed contaminants could disperse to as many as 50 (clover) or 80 (ryegrass) countries within 10 time-steps. Risk assessed via network models differed 18\% (ryegrass) or 48\% (clover) of the time compared to risk assessed on trade volumes. We conclude that biosecurity risk is driven by network position, the number of trading connections and trade volume. Risk mitigation measures could involve the use of more comprehensive lists of regulated species, comprehensive inspection protocols, or the addition of field surveillance at farms where seed is planted.},

  abstract = {To estimate the prevalence of herbicide-resistant weeds, 87 wheat and barley farms were randomly surveyed in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Over 600 weed seed samples from up to 10 mother plants per taxon depending on abundance, were collected immediately prior to harvest (two fields per farm). Some samples provided by agronomists were tested on an ad-hoc basis. Over 40,000 seedlings were grown to the 2–4 leaf stage in glasshouse conditions and sprayed with high priority herbicides for grasses from the three modes-of-action acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibitors haloxyfop, fenoxaprop, clodinafop, pinoxaden, clethodim, acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibitors iodosulfuron, pyroxsulam, nicosulfuron, and the 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS)-inhibitor glyphosate. The highest manufacturer recommended label rates were applied for the products registered for use in New Zealand, often higher than the discriminatory rates used in studies elsewhere. Published studies of resistance were rare in New Zealand but we found weeds survived herbicide applications on 42 of the 87 (48\%) randomly surveyed farms, while susceptible reference populations died. Resistance was found for ALS-inhibitors on 35 farms (40\%) and to ACCase-inhibitors on 20 (23\%) farms. The number of farms with resistant weeds (denominator is 87 farms) are reported for ACCase-inhibitors, ALS-inhibitors, and glyphosate respectively as:               Avena fatua               (9\%, 1\%, 0\% of farms),               Bromus catharticus               (0\%, 2\%, 0\%),               Lolium               spp. (17\%, 28\%, 0\%),               Phalaris minor               (1\%, 6\%, 0\%), and               Vulpia bromoides               (0\%, not tested, 0\%).

I estimate the time and dollar cost of eradication of R. adenotrichos and R. megaloccocus to be US\$11 ,322 US dollars/1 738 hours. More than half of these costs were sustained in extensive systematic searches of 330 ha surrounding known infestations. Herbicide accounted for less than 1\% of total costs. Control was undertaken using the herbicides glyphosate, and a combination of metsulfuron methyl and picloram. I recommend using teams of workers dedicated to eradicating known or potentially invasive species early in the invasion process or prior to establishment in Galapagos.}

  abstract = {Policymakers and donors often need to identify the locations where technologies are most likely to have important effects, to increase the benefits from agricultural development or extension efforts. Higher quality information may help to target the high-benefit locations, but often actions are needed with limited information. The value of information (VOI) in this context is formalized by evaluating the results of decision making guided by a set of specific information compared to the results of acting without considering that information. We present a framework for management performance mapping that includes evaluating the VOI for decision making about geographic priorities in regional intervention strategies, in case studies of Andean and Kenyan potato seed systems. We illustrate use of recursive partitioning, XGBoost, and Bayesian network models to characterize the relationships among seed health and yield responses and environmental and management predictors used in studies of seed degeneration. These analyses address the expected performance of an intervention based on geographic predictor variables. In the Andean example, positive selection of seed from asymptomatic plants was more effective at high altitudes in Ecuador. In the Kenyan example, there was the potential to target locations with higher technology adoption rates and with higher potato cropland connectivity, i.e., a likely more important role in regional epidemics. Targeting training to high management performance areas would often provide more benefits than would random selection of target areas. We illustrate how assessing the VOI can contribute to targeted development programs and support a culture of continuous improvement for interventions.},

  abstract = {Cyperaceae is a family of Monocotyledons comprised of species with holocentric chromosomes that are associated with intense dysploidy and polyploidy events. Within this family the genus Rhynchospora has recently become the focus of several studies that characterize the organization of the holocentric karyotype and genome structures. To broaden our understanding of genome evolution in this genus, representatives of Rhynchospora were studied to contrast chromosome features, C-CMA/DAPI band distribution and genome sizes. Here, we carried out a comparative analysis for 35 taxa of Rhynchospora, and generated new genome size estimates for 20 taxa. The DNA 2C-values varied up to 22-fold, from 2C = 0.51 pg to 11.32 pg, and chromosome numbers ranged from 2n = 4 to 61. At least 37\% of our sampling exhibited 2n different from the basic number x = 5, and chromosome rearrangements were also observed. A large variation in C-CMA/DAPI band accumulation and distribution was observed as well. We show that genome variation in Rhynchospora is much larger than previously reported. Phylogenetic analysis showed that most taxa were grouped in clades corresponding to previously described taxonomic sections. Basic chromosome numbers are the same within every section, however, changes appeared in all the clades. Ancestral chromosome number reconstruction revealed n = 5 as the most likely ancestral complements, but n = 10 appears as a new possibility. Chromosome evolution models point to polyploidy as the major driver of chromosome evolution in Rhynchospora, followed by dysploidy. A negative correlation between chromosome size and diploid number open the discussion for holokinetic drive-based genome evolution. This study explores relationships between karyotype differentiation and genome size variation in Rhynchospora, and contrasts it against the phylogeny of this holocentric group.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The genomic revolution offers renewed hope of resolving rapid radiations in the Tree of Life. The development of the multispecies coalescent model and improved gene tree estimation methods can better accommodate gene tree heterogeneity caused by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and gene tree estimation error stemming from the short internal branches. However, the relative influence of these factors in species tree inference is not well understood. Using anchored hybrid enrichment, we generated a data set including 423 single-copy loci from 64 taxa representing 39 families to infer the species tree of the flowering plant order Malpighiales. This order includes 9 of the top 10 most unstable nodes in angiosperms, which have been hypothesized to arise from the rapid radiation during the Cretaceous. Here, we show that coalescent-based methods do not resolve the backbone of Malpighiales and concatenation methods yield inconsistent estimations, providing evidence that gene tree heterogeneity is high in this clade. Despite high levels of ILS and gene tree estimation error, our simulations demonstrate that these two factors alone are insufficient to explain the lack of resolution in this order. To explore this further, we examined triplet frequencies among empirical gene trees and discovered some of them deviated significantly from those attributed to ILS and estimation error, suggesting gene flow as an additional and previously unappreciated phenomenon promoting gene tree variation in Malpighiales. Finally, we applied a novel method to quantify the relative contribution of these three primary sources of gene tree heterogeneity and demonstrated that ILS, gene tree estimation error, and gene flow contributed to 10.0\$\textbackslash\%\$, 34.8\$\textbackslash\%\$, and 21.4\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the variation, respectively. Together, our results suggest that a perfect storm of factors likely influence this lack of resolution, and further indicate that recalcitrant phylogenetic relationships like the backbone of Malpighiales may be better represented as phylogenetic networks. Thus, reducing such groups solely to existing models that adhere strictly to bifurcating trees greatly oversimplifies reality, and obscures our ability to more clearly discern the process of evolution.

  abstract = {ABSTRACTPastures represent about half of the global agricultural area and productivity losses from weeds are significant. The complex interactions between them and other pasture plants, livestock and the environment imply a need for innovative research that transforms pasture management. To this end, a horizon scan was conducted to identify relevant issues, questions, opportunities, and drivers. The drivers were ranked using three criteria: (1) is this a horizon (is the driver likely to become important in 10–20 years?); (2) will the research require stretchy science (is it currently not well addressed by the science community?); (3) is the research transformative (will successful scientific research in this area lead to significant changes to weed management in pastures?). We identified 11 major issues and 46 subordinate ones. The three highest ranked major issues were: (1) anticipated reductions in access to herbicides; (2) rethinking weed management under an ecosystem services paradigm; (3) responding to shifts in best practice and the regulations that are altering farm system planning to reduce farming’s environmental impacts. We conclude that fundamental interdisciplinary research is needed that addresses biosecurity and weed management issues, while reducing the environmental footprint of farming and maintaining productivity.}

Optimal management of this weed may be achieved when the environmental factors that affect its emergence are well understood. Emergence may then be predicted and manipulated through land management techniques, e.g. through the promotion of germination (irrigation) or the prevention of it (soil inversion), thus enabling optimisation of weed control. The hydrothermal time for germination of V. bromoides was determined in order to better understand when germination and emergence occurs and how environmental conditions including soil temperature (T) and water potential (Ψ) may influence this. The germination profile of V. bromoides was determined on a thermogradient table. Seeds were also incubated under constant factorial combinations of temperature and water potential in order to better understand the water potential required for the germination of this species. The rate of germination of V. bromoides was slowest from 5 to 7°C and most rapid from 13 to 32°C. At temperatures of 5 to 15°C V. bromoides experienced reduced germination rates at water potentials between –0.75 to –1.00 MPa. At temperatures of 20 and 25°C V. bromoides germinated rapidly across all of the water potentials assessed. These results will inform the development of optimised weed management on farm.},

  abstract = {This chapter presents an overview of the process undertaken to understand alien plant invasions and work towards their effective management in the Galapagos Islands. Galapagos is a unique case study for the management of alien plants in protected areas because much the archipelago has few alien plants and the original ecosystems are relatively intact. We discuss a pragmatic approach developed over 15 years to help prioritise management of 871 plant species introduced to the islands. This approach includes understanding invasion pathways; identifying which species are present and their distribution; determining invasive species impact on biodiversity, ecosystem function and mutualisms; prioritising management using weed risk assessment; guidelines to prevent further introduction through quarantine and early intervention; and developing methods to control or eradicate priority species. Principal barriers to application of the approach are limited capacity and coordination among managers and inherent difficulties arising from invasive species traits such as seed banks and dispersal and their interactions with ecosystems. We also discuss the approach of managing invasive species individually and suggest it may be more appropriate, when feasible, for the relatively intact uninhabited islands and dry regions of Galapagos. The more degraded highlands of the inhabited islands need a more complex approach that balances costs with prioritised outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem functionality.},

  abstract = {Resistance to iodosulfuron, a herbicide targeting acetolactate synthase (ALS), was identified and characterised in a population of Lolium perenne L. from Canterbury, New Zealand. The resistant population was 264 times more resistant to iodosulfuron than a susceptible population, based on a ratio of the rate corresponding to a 50\% reduction in resistant and susceptible plant survival (R/S LD50). The resistant population was also 14times more resistant to nicosulfuron, another ALS-inhibitor of the same class. However, no resistance to imazapyr, an ALS-inhibitor from a different chemical class, was detected in the resistant population. Pre-treatment with an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 reduced the level of iodosulfuron resistance to 46-fold in the resistant population, suggesting enhanced herbicide metabolism, a non-target site mechanism, contributed to resistance of this herbicide. In addition, a proline to leucine substitution at codon 197 was detected, suggesting a target-site-based mechanism was also associated with resistance to iodosulfuron. This is the first report on the resistance mechanisms to ALS-inhibiting herbicides identified in Lolium perenne in New Zealand and highlights the importance of integrated weed management approaches to reduce the likelihood of ALS-inhibitor herbicide resistance becoming more widespread.},

  abstract = {The number of herbicide-resistant weeds is increasing globally. A successful management practice requires an understanding of how resistance traits are inherited. Weed scientists worldwide have investigated the mode of inheritance for herbicide resistance in weeds. Depending on the resistance gene/mechanism, varied patterns of inheritance have been documented in weed species. In most of the target-enzyme mechanism cases, the mode of inheritance involves a single nuclear gene. However, maternal (cytoplasmic) inheritance has also been documented for triazine-resistant weeds with the target-enzyme mutation mechanism of resistance. Resistance from target-enzyme overexpression is not always associated with the single-gene model of inheritance. Depending on the type of resistance, allelic dominance varies between complete dominance, semi-dominance and recessive for both target-enzyme mutation and target-enzyme overexpression mechanisms. The nontarget site mechanism of resistance is however, more complex. The pattern of inheritance in weeds with nontarget site resistance is quite variable and should be investigated case by case. The pattern of inheritance has a crucial role in the dynamics of herbicide-resistance within a weed population, and knowledge about the inheritance of herbicide resistance traits could help develop predictive models and novel strategies to prevent the spread of resistance allele(s).},

  abstract = {The first step in managing herbicide-resistant weeds is to confirm their resistance status. It is, therefore, crucial to have a rapid, reliable and cost-effective technique to assess samples for herbicide resistance. We designed and evaluated three derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) markers for detecting glyphosate resistance in               Lolium perenne               . conferred by non-synonymous mutations at codon-106 in the               enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase               (               EPSPS               ) gene. The dCAPS markers involve amplification of the target region, digestion of the amplified products with restriction enzymes and gel-based visualisation of the digested products. The results showed that all three dCAPS markers could successfully detect mutations at codon-106 in the target enzyme. The dCAPS markers can also inform us of the zygosity state of the resistance allele and was confirmed by sequencing the target region of the               EPSPS               gene. The markers described here are effective quick tests for the monitoring and evaluation of the target-enzyme mechanism of glyphosate resistance in               Lolium perenne               .},

  abstract = {Application of herbicides inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) has been one of the main strategies for selectively controlling grass weed species such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) in wheat and barley crops in New Zealand. In this study, we have confirmed and characterized resistance to pinoxaden, an ACCaseinhibiting herbicide, in a population of L. perenne. Dose-response experiments were conducted to assess the level of pinoxaden resistance, and based on the LD50 values, the studied population was 41.4-times more resistant to pinoxaden than a susceptible population. Application of malathion, an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450s, preceding pinoxaden treatment reduced the level of resistance to 9.7-fold. However, pre-treatment with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibitor 4-chloro7- nitrobenzoxadiazole prior to pinoxaden treatment did not affect pinoxaden resistance. Partial sequencing of the ACCase gene revealed that the resistant population had an isoleucine to valine replacement at position 2041. These results suggest that both cytochrome P450-based and target-site mechanisms are jointly associated with this instance of pinoxaden resistance in L. perenne. The pinoxaden-resistant L. perenne individuals were also resistant to quizalofop-p-ethyl (108.6-fold), but they were susceptible to clethodim, which can, therefore, be used to manage this pinoxaden-resistant L. perenne. This is the first report of a L. perenne population in which a rare target-site mutation works in concert with enhanced cy­ tochrome P-450 activity to confer pinoxaden resistance. Evolution of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in this L. perenne population indicates that integrated weed management practices are required to prevent widespread resistance developing in New Zealand cereal crop systems.},

Seventeen species previously known to occur only in cultivation in Galapagos are now considered escaped. A number of species known to be naturalized in the humid highlands of Santa Cruz do not appear to be able to reproduce in Puerto Ayora's drier climate. To determine which introduced species should be a priority for control or eradication, the potential invasiveness of each species was assessed based on their distribution and behaviour in Galapagos and elsewhere. At least 13 species were considered potentially serious invaders that could be feasible to eradicate.}

Plants introduced to rural areas in the humid highlands and urban areas on the arid coast act as foci for invasion of the surrounding Galapagos National Park. Here we present results of the most comprehensive inventory to date of alien vascular plants in the inhabited areas of Galapagos. The survey was conducted between 2002 and 2007, in 6031 properties (97\% of the total) on Floreana, Isabela, San Cristobal and Santa Cruz Islands. In total 754 alien vascular plant taxa were recorded, representing 468 genera in 123 families. Dicotyledons represented 554 taxa, monocotyledons 183, there were 7 gymnosperms and 10 pteridophytes. Almost half (363) of the taxa were herbaceous. The most represented families were Fabaceae (sensu lato), Asteraceae and Poaceae. The three most recorded species in the humid rural areas were Psidium guajava, Passiflora edulis and Bryophyllum pinnatum, and in the dry urban areas, Aloe vera, Portulaca oleracea and Carica papaya. In total, 264 (35\%) taxa were recorded as naturalized. The most common use for taxa was ornamental (52\%). This extensive survey has increased the known alien vascular flora of Galapagos by 257 species, giving a ratio of alien to native taxa of 1.57∶1. It provides a crucial baseline for plant invasion management in the archipelago and contributes data for meta analyses of invasion processes worldwide. A repeat of the survey in the future would act as an effective early detection tool to help avoid further invasion of the Galapagos National Park.}

We visited all 1193 village properties to record the presence of the introduced plants. In addition, information was collected from half of the properties to determine evidence for potential invasiveness of the plant species. We recorded 261 vascular taxa, 13 of which were new records for Galapagos. Most of the species were intentionally grown (cultivated) (73.3\%) and used principally as ornamentals. The most frequent taxa we encountered were Cocos nucifera (coconut tree) (22.1\%) as a cultivated plant and Paspalum vaginatum (salt water couch) (13.2\%) as a non cultivated plant. In addition 39 taxa were naturalized. On the basis of the invasiveness study, we recommend five species for eradication (Abutilon dianthum, Datura inoxia, Datura metel, Senna alata and Solanum capsicoides), one species for hybridization studies (Opuntia ficus-indica) and three species for control (Furcraea hexapetala, Leucaena leucocephala and Paspalum vaginatum).}

A protocol was used that accounts for both the risk that different herbicides will select for resistance and each weed’s propensity to develop herbicide resistance based on the number of cases worldwide. To provide context we documented current herbicide use patterns. Most weeds (55) were low-risk, 30 were medium-risk and 16 high-risk. The top ten scored weeds were Echinochloa crus-galli, Poa annua, Lolium multiflorum, Erigeron sumatrensis, Raphanus raphanistrum, Lolium perenne, Erigeron bonariensis, Avena fatua, Avena sterilis and Digitaria sanguinalis. Seven out of ten high-risk weeds were grasses. The most used herbicides were synthetic auxins, an enolpyruvylshikimate-phosphate synthase inhibitor, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors, and long-chain fatty acid inhibitors. ALS-inhibitors were assessed as posing the greatest risk for more species than other modes-of-action. Despite pre-emergence herbicides being known to delay resistance, New Zealand farmers only applied flufenacet and terbuthlazine with high frequency. Based on our analysis, surveys for herbicideresistant species should focus on the high-risk species we identified. Farmer extension efforts in New Zealand should address resistance evolution in cropping weeds.},

  abstract = {Despite an extensive history of research into herbicide resistance in New Zealand maize, some aspects remain understudied. Herbicide resistance was first detected in New Zealand in the 1980s in maize crops, with atrazine resistance in Chenopodium album L. and Persicaria maculosa Gray. Since then, Chenopodium album has also developed resistance to dicamba, and in the last five years Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. populations have been reported to be resistant to nicosulfuron. Here we estimate the risk of herbicide resistance arising in 39 common maize weeds. A list of weeds associated with maize was generated, omitting uncommon weeds and those that grow outside of the maize growing season. Weeds were ranked for their risk of evolving herbicide resistance with a scoring protocol that accounts for the specific herbicides used in New Zealand maize. Seven weed species were classified as having a high risk of developing herbicide resistance: Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.Beauv., Chenopodium album, Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn., Xanthium strumarium L., Amaranthus powellii S.Watson, Solanum nigrum L. and Digitaria sanguinalis. Seventeen species were classed as moderate risk, and 15 were low risk. Herbicide classes associated with more resistant species were classed as high risk,these included acetohydroxy acid synthase inhibitors and photosystem-II inhibitors. Synthetic auxins had a ~moderate risk but only two herbicides in this class (dicamba and clopyralid) are registered for maize in New Zealand. Other herbicide mode-of-action groups used in maize were low risk. We recommend outreach ~to farmers regarding weed-control strategies that prevent high-risk species from developing resistance. High-risk herbicide groups should be monitored for losses of efficacy. Resistance surveys should focus on these species and herbicides.},
