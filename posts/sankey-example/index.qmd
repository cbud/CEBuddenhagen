I first learned about a Sankey graph from Tufte's data visualization
book [@tufte1983visual]. It is a heartbreaking image of Napoleon's army's
attempt to invade Moscow, but instead of victory, thousands died through
a mix of war and unhygienic and freezing weather as the marched to
Moscow and back to France. My purposes for this post are much more
mundane, quite unimportant relatively - to look at weightings of a
project with criteria.

How can data be used to generate a Sankey graph? You need project and
criteria node names arranged in terms of weights and the target and
sources for links @tbl-data. This way nodes and links are sized
according the assigned weights @fig-sankey - an example of its
application is in my other post for our [weed horizon
scan](https://cbuddenhagen.quarto.pub/notes-from-a-from-a-plant-biologist/posts/weed-horizon-scan/).

The package is a network package
`networkD3`@allaireNetworkD3D3JavaScript2017.

```{r}
#| warning: false

#Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(networkD3)
library(kableExtra)
```

The data can be read in from an external file, you need the nodes to be
listed and numbered from 0 and on up to the number of nodes in one file,
the names should match the criteria and project titles @tbl-nodes.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-nodes
#| tbl-cap: The nodes need to be numbered from zero up.
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,50]

nodes<-
  structure(
  list(
    source = 0:7, #node numbering starts at zero
    target_name = c(
      "1 project",
      "2 project",
      "3 project",
      "4 project",
      "5 project",
      "Proportion of work that is plant science",
      "Stakeholders will benefit",
      "Is not well addressed by others"
    )
  ),
  row.names = c(NA,-8L),
  class = "data.frame"
)

kable(nodes %>% arrange(source), align="l", format = "pipe", padding = 2)
```

Generate some random weights for this exercise, I am using 3 criteria,
for the 5 projects so I need 15 weights.

```{r}
weights<-sample(1:10, 15, replace=T)
```

Then generate the table with project names and weights. The link colors
are determined by the names on the nodes and it can have problems
recognizing names as unique if the first word is the same and there are
spaces. I used Project 1, Project 2, etc and it didn't recognize the
nodes as distinct until I named them 1 Project, 2 Project, etc.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-data
#| tbl-cap: Data arrangement includes projects, criteria and weights.


target_source <-
  tibble(
    source_name = c(rep(
      c(
        "Proportion of work that is plant science",
        "Stakeholders will benefit",
        "Is not well addressed by others"
      ),
      5
    )),
    target_name = c(rep(
      c("1 project",
        "2 project",
        "3 project",
        "4 project",
        "5 project"),
      3
    )),
    weight=as.numeric(c(weights)),
    target = c(rep(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4), 3)),
    source = c(rep(c(5, 6, 7), 5))
    
    ) 

kable(target_source %>% arrange(target_name), align="c", format = "pipe", padding = 2)
```

Then generate the @fig-sankey. Just note it is outputting and html
widget, looks a lot better on a desktop screen.

                                  fontSize = 18,
                                  LinkGroup="target_name", 
                                  fontFamily = "Georgia")
