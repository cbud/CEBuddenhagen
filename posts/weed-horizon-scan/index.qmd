# A horizon scan for pastoral weed research

This is my first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome! Here I share recent effort we made at AgResearch Ltd. via an interdisciplinary expert elicitation workshop to identify drivers of innovative weed research for the pastoral sector @doi:10.1080/00288233.2022.2107026. This builds on an earlier strategic more applied research document @bourdotPastoralSectorWeeds2018.

The main drivers we identified were ranked by participants using the criteria (1) is this a horizon (is the driver likely to become important in 10--20 years?); (2) will the research require stretchy science (is it currently not well addressed by the science community?); (3) is the research transformative (will successful scientific research in this area lead to significant changes to weed management in pastures?). We depicted the relative ranks using a nifty Sankey diagram @allaireNetworkD3D3JavaScript2017 from the `networkD3` package in `R`.

### Post script

To set this blog up I followed the guidelines at [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html), with some nice pointers from a data witch @navarro2022.
