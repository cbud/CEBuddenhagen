# Global weed compendium network

This is a co-occurrence network I made from a weed species by [geographic region list](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Global-Weed-Country-Dataset-available) - an output from Rod Randall's *fantastic* Global Weeds Compendium @randallGlobalCompendiumWeeds2017. This is not to be confused with CABI's *awesome* [Invasive Species Compendium](https://www.cabi.org/isc/ "CABI Invasive Species Compendium") (ISC). I contributed a few data sheets for their compendium a few years ago [@buddenhagenBuddlejaAsiaticaDog2016; @buddenhagenChristellaDentataSoft2014; @buddenhagenCinnamomumBurmanniPadang2015;  @buddenhagenCyclosorusParasiticusParasitic2013; @buddenhagenPassifloraEdulisPassionfruit2014;  @buddenhagenSetariaParvifloraKnotroot2013; @buddenhagenSolanumCapsicoidesCockroach2014].

![A co-occurrence network of highly weighted links between countries based on shared weed species between countries described in the Global Compendium of Weeds.](country%20network.png)

I used the `igraph` and `ggraph` packages to make the network @csardiIgraphSoftwarePackage2006. This is much reduced by using only highly weighted links - otherwise its too huge because Randall's dataset is big! I think this "stress" layout makes nodes means countries that share more species are closer together. Let's compare the Australian and New Zealand location in the network topology. Here NZ is more similar to temperate Asian countries and Europe, while Australia shares species with drier Mediterranean climates, tropical America and Asia.

## Code

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
```

``` r
#read in data from Randall's compendium https://www.researchgate.net/project/Global-Weed-Country-Dataset-available
country_spp<-read_xlsx("Randall 2017 Global Compendium countries with species.xlsx")
```

``` r
#make links
country_spp<-country_spp %>% rename("to"=`Full taxa name with author citation`) %>%  rename("from"=`Compendium Country`) %>% select("from", "to")
#adjacency matrix country shared species
country_by_spp <- table(country_spp)

#make adjacency matrix
adjacency <- country_by_spp %*% t(country_by_spp)
diag(adjacency)<-0 #remove self loops
```

``` r
#use igraph to make igraph object
g<-graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adjacency,weighted=T, mode="undirected")
#get attributes
attributes(V(g))
```

``` r
#see which node is the NZ node.
V(g)$name=="New Zealand"
```

``` r
#get reduced graph baed on edge weights
g_sub <- delete.edges(g, E(g)[weight <= max(weight)*.15]) #reduces links by link weight
g_sub <- delete.vertices(g_sub , which(degree(g_sub)==0)) #removes isolated nodes after links are removed
```

``` r
#ggraph is a tidy implementation of igraph

 ggraph(g_sub, layout = 'kk') + 
   geom_edge_fan(aes(colour = weight, alpha = stat(index))) + 
   geom_node_text(aes(label = name, size=1), colour="darkgreen")+
   theme(legend.position="none")
```

``` r
ggsave("country network.png", width=11, height=11)
```
